### Cutomer Segments

#### Description

Used unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers in distinct categories. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

#### Method

PCA and KMeans from sklearn are used for data dimensioni reductiona and clustering. 

#### Instruction

To run the program: `python customer_segments.py`

#### Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
